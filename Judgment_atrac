"MY TWO FAVORITE THINGS IN THE WORLD!! I love cheese cake and ice cream, this looks so good",5

I loke pasta and this looks pretty good although basic,5
This is a strange one because on one hand the lighting is really good and the use of perspective is also pretty good. However the image falls apart when you take the contents into consideration - it's just a pot of spaghetti with almost zero artistical flare. There is no attempt to style or form the spaghetti in an eye-catching way. It just looks messy.

"It is a good image and it displays the contents clear enough, but i feel it's a little out of balance. The photo contains too much of the top half, which also happens to be blurry. The focus should instead be on the cut slices and that should be taking up more of the image ration, with the rest of the contents blurred in the background. It feels this images ratio is the wrong way around. The lighting is very good though. Overall, with a little more thought it could be presented better.",5
"Bars look very sweet and full of sugar , I try to stay away from sugary foods .",5
"Great, i believe tho, if the image was taken a bit more like the people can see how high the bar is, would be better. Overally veyr nice picture.",5

"Restaurant quality photo along with serving, although I'm not a fan of prawns, so less attractive to me.",5
"This photo does feel presentable and it is definitely trying to show itself as an artful image, but it feels lop-sided in some respects. The use or ornaments on the lower left half makes the focal point of the image (the dish) feel disjointed and shoved to the side. The contents of the dish itself though is presented well with decent lighting.",5
